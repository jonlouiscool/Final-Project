CheckPoint #2
Project question:
##How do History Scholars view videos games?

The first idea brought to myself was the idea of looking at games in terms of profit and how games have evolved in that sense.
Essentially, looking at the timeline of games and how much a game has made each year of release. 

Once I have complied this information, I would like to put it in chart form in order to create a visualization of the data I have collected.

Continuing forward, by creating this visualization, it would show the pattern of games played amoungst people to answer the question:
What games are popular when?
Scholars may look at this chart and contrast this idea with what could be next in gaming development or what might hit popularity. 

##Problem

The one problem with this idea is what about free to play games?

Free to play games generate profit off of the people who want to advance in the game with the use of money.
Should these games count? Example: League of legends, Dota Being some of the most popular games to date.

Furthermore, will that change the research of games in popularity, in which should the game be based off 1 of 2 things:
Profit or popularity or both. 

I believe if time permitts i would like to do both ideas in a chart form because it seems to be viable for people to know.
Profit allows for scholars to see how much the industry is making,
while popularity shows the amount of people interested in this growing market.
Both ideas important but are they both needed?
